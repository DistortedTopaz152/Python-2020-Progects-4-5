#pythone will let you not loose any data by converting data types

number = 42 #you don't need to state that something is an integer
number2 = 8.0 #if it has a desimole in the componit or the answer it will come back as a flote
check = type(number)
check2 = type(number2) # displays the type of data something is

#answer = number / number2*6+7-(58*9/4)+9-7*8 #divition will always convert to flote

answer = 10%5 #hard coded is not a good practice
#if something is sepose to change make it variables

print("pie"+str(number)) #multiplying a string repeats the sting and adding strings combinds them
#casting is how str converts to string int to integer float to flote and bool to boolion
print(answer)
print(type(answer))
