  Do not read this book straight through from beginning to end! These pages contain many different adventures you can have as you try to reach the Underground Kingdom. 
  From time to time as you read along, you will be asked to make a choice. Your choice may lead to success or to disaster! The adventures you have will be the result of the decisions you make. 
  After you make your choice, follow the instructions to see what happens to you next.
	SPECIAL WARNING!!!!
  The Underground Kingdom is not easy to reach. Many players never get there. Others never return. Before starting out on your journey, you may want to read Professor Bruckner's theory, which is set forth on the pages that follow. 
  Professor Bruckner is a rather boring writer, and I wouldn't suggest that you bother to read his theory, except that, if you ever get to the Underground Kingdom, it might save your life. 
  Good luck!""")

def PROFESSOR_BRUCKNERS_THEORY():
    print("""
    The discovery of the Bottomless Crevasse in Greenland by Dr. Nera Vivaldi supports my theory that the earth is not solid, as has been thought, but that it is hollow. 
    The Bottomless Crevasse is probably the sole route from the earth's surface to a vast "Underground Kingdom." The only other possible link would be an underground river, flowing in alternating directions in response to the tides, but this seems unlikely.
    How, you may ask, was the earth hollowed out? My studies show that more than a billion years ago a tiny black hole collided with our planet and lodged in its center, pulling the whole molten core into an incredibly massive sphere only a few hundred meters
    across. If you were to stand on the inner surface of the earth, like a fly on the inner shell of an enormous pumpkin, you would see the black hole directly overhead, like a black sun. The gravity of the earth's thick shell would hold you to the inner shell 
    of the earth, though you would weigh much less than you would on the outer surface because the mass of the Black Sun would tend to pull you toward it. If
	there were a very tall mountain in the Underground Kingdom and you were to climb to the top of it, you might be pulled up into the Black Sun because gravity gets stronger as you approach a massive object. In all other respects the Black Sun would not be 
    dangerous to any creatures in the Underground Kingdom. On the contrary, the Black Sun would be necessary to life in the underworld, but in the opposite way that the sun is necessary to life on the earth's surface. Our sun gives us heat and keeps us from
    freezing. The Black Sun absorbs heat. If there is an underground kingdom, it is the Black Sun that keeps its inhabitants from being baked to death by the heat within the earth!""")

    You are standing on the Toan Glacier in northern Greenland, staring down into the black void of the crevasse. You shiver as you wonder whether you were lucky or unlucky to be invited on this expedition. 
    Standing next to you are Gunnar Larsen of the National Research Institute and Dr. James Sneed, a geologist. A small black box containing a signal transmitter is suspended over the crevasse by two long poles. 
    The transmitter is wired to a console a few yards away in the ice. Dr. Sneed turns a dial as he monitors the display screen. "Well?" Larsen's voice is impatient. Sneed looks up, a broad smile on his face. 
    "This is it, friends—the Bottomless Crevasse." "Any radar return?" Larsen asks. Sneed shakes his head. "None." For a minute no one speaks. Like you, the others must feel excited to have reached their goal but also a little sad.

    "Why is it so bright—?"
    You are interrupted by cries from Mopur.
    "Clera! The Flying Clera!"
    Craning your neck, you see several great birdlike creatures swooping across the sky.

    your ears, but with your whole body.
    Like you, Dr. Vivaldi seems hypnotized. "They
    sound truly angelic," she says.

    place for us," he says. "We are not ready."
    "I have a strong feeling that we must turn
    back," says Dr. Vivaldi.
    "Yes," you say, "I have the same feeling. Some
    force is pulling us back."
    Dr. Vivaldi's gaze is fixed on the Shining Mountains. "The Flying Clera are a very advanced
    species," she explains. "They have the ability to
    project their feelings onto us. Their presence and
    purpose here is a mystery that I suspect we are

    desire to return home, to the surface of the earth.
