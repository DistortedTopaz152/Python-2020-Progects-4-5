    "Then we must hurry," says Dr. Vivaldi. "Akpar, there is not much you can do but lead us to
    the crater where we arrived."
    The Grand Akpar speaks in his own tongue to
    a guard, who quickly leaves the chamber. Turning
    to you he says, "I shall have a boat readied to
    take you across the Great River. Come then, we
    will guide you back to the secret canyon."
    After a three-tides' journey you and Dr. Vivaldi,
    guided by a party of Archpods, reach the Bottomless Crevasse. Dr. Vivaldi runs toward a small
    metal craft on the crater floor.
    "A Vertacraft!" she says. "With luck this will get
    us back to the earth's surface."
    Dr. Vivaldi gives instructions to the Archpods,
    who then use their ropes to suspend the craft
    directly over the shaft of the crevasse. You and Dr.
    Vivaldi thank your hosts and bid them farewell.
    The canopy cover closes. You watch anxiously as
    Dr. Vivaldi checks out the instruments. "Are you
    ready?" she asks.
    "Ready." You grit your teeth as the Vertacraft
    accelerates into the crevasse and begins the 800-
    mile descent to the surface of the earth. You're
    pressed flat against your seat. The g force is terrific! It's getting worse. What's happening? Can't
    Dr. Vivaldi stop it? You're blacking out.""")

    the Weightless Peaks. With you is a young Archpod named Katu, chosen because she speaks
    your language.
    On the trek from the Archpod village to the
    Weightless Peaks, Katu tells you the legend of the
    Archpods who traveled through a shaft that led to
    a new universe. Few Archpods believed there
    could be such a place. Most of them thought that
    the earth was infinitely thick, that nothing could
    lie beyond it. "Now that human beings have arrived, we know that there is a whole new world
    right under our feet. We call your world the
    Nether World," she says. "We are curious about
    it. But we are also afraid of it, and of its creatures
    who could destroy us."
    "Sometimes we human beings are afraid of
    ourselves," you reply.
    After hiking for fourteen tides, you begin to
    climb—first gentle hills, then steep mountains.
    You tire under the weight of your pack, but Dr.
    Vivaldi urges you on. "It will soon be easier," she
    says. And she is proven correct, for as you struggle up the next steep hill, you feel your pack
    growing lighter, and you feel lighter too. Ahead of
    you, Katu is bounding up the higher peaks like a

    peak of all. Its top is a spire jutting into the sky. A
    thin plume of smoke rises from the top.
    "It must be a volcano," you say.
    "No," says Dr. Vivaldi. "Something else is
    going on. The mountain's gravity at its peak is so
    weak that dust is being pulled off by the tremendous gravity of the Black Sun."
    "I bet I only weigh five or six pounds," you say.
    "I could easily climb to the top of that spire."
    "Better not," says Dr. Vivaldi.
    You realize that if you're so light, the huge
    boulders around you can't weigh very much either. You decide to test your theory. You nudge a
    boulder twice your size. It rolls into another boulder. Then above you, Katu screams, "Avalanche!"""")

    The Archpods provide you and Dr. Vivaldi with
    their largest boat for the trip down the Great River
    to the diamond hills.
    After a journey of six tides, you hear a roaring
    up ahead. The Archpods quickly beach the boat.
    "We can go no farther," the leader tells you.
    "There are deep canyons and fierce rapids
    ahead. We must go on foot across the field of
    white clay."
    You soon find that the white clay is extremely
    hot. Your feet would burn up were it not for the
    light gravity of the underworld that permits you to
    race across the field in great leaps.

    "I'm returning us to the surface, Professor."
    Your voice is cool. You feel confident now that
    the Vertacraft has responded to your command.

    for this gravitation."

    the surface," says Dr. Vivaldi. "They may have
    evolved on some other planet."
    You fall silent as the music of the Flying Clera
    begins—a great chorus you hear not only with
    your ears, but with your whole body.
    Like you, Dr. Vivaldi seems hypnotized. "They
    sound truly angelic," she says.
    But Mopur tugs at your sleeves. "This is not the
    place for us," he says. "We are not ready."

    back," says Dr. Vivaldi.

    force is pulling us back."

    species," she explains. "They have the ability to
    project their feelings onto us. Their presence and
